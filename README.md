Translating texts is very challenging for a machine since the text has the complicated words
structures and different word sequences express completely different emotions.. Moreover, it
becomes more difficult if the texts include irregular word orders, emojis, website url, and
buzzwords. Social media contents provide abundant text sources for natural language processing
(NLP) research, however, they have all these features.
Social media allows people to share events, opinions, and emotions efficiently. Twitter, as one of
the most popular social media platforms, has more than 500 million tweets per day. These
resources are valuable for Natural Language Processing due to the wide availability and
novelties.
In this project, we used the labels data from SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets.[1] The
features of the data include ID, Tweet, Affect Dimension, and Intensity Class. Among the four
different languages, we chosed English Tweets to analyze.
